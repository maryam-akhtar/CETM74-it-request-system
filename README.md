## Project Overview
This project forms **Part 1** of the module.
It demonstrates the **design and front-end prototype** of an **IT Request Logging System** for a secondary school (WearView Academy).

The system aims to allow school staff to report IT issues efficiently to their in-house IT support team through a simple and responsive web interface.

## Project Components

### **Part A – Design Documentation**
Includes:
- Digital Moodboard  
- Low- and High-Fidelity Wireframes  
- Website Structure Diagram  
- 500-word Design Rationale

These artefacts show the planning and design stages for the IT Request System, ensuring the prototype is **accessible**, **user-friendly**, and **fit for purpose**.

### **Part B – Front-End Development**
A working **prototype webpage** that allows staff to log IT requests.  
Built using:
- **HTML5** – semantic and W3C validated  
- **CSS3** – responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile  
- **JavaScript** – client-side validation for required fields and email addresses  

Validation ensures:
- All required fields are completed  
- The email format is correct  
- Users receive clear error messages  

### **Part C – Demonstration**
A **5–10 minute screencast** demonstrates:
- How the form validation works  
- How the design responds to various screen sizes using browser developer tools  

Watch here: [Part C – Screencast](./demo/Part%20C%20-%20ScreenCast.mp4)

### **Part D – Critical Evaluation**
A 1000-word reflection on:
- How well the final webpage matches the design plan  
- Accessibility, usability, and responsiveness  
- Challenges faced and potential future improvements
